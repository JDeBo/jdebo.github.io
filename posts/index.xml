      <description>In 2015 I got my first opportunity to visit Havana Cuba with the Millikin Percussion Studio. While we were there we spent a week studying Cuban folkloric and popular music with some of the most renowned teachers in the country. After returning from that trip and joining Millikin&amp;rsquo;s Latin Jazz project, I got to record an album inspired by the Afro-Cuban rhythms and songs we learned while we were there. Balance Issues combined elements of rhumba, salsa and comparsa music with jazz and funk to make a series of songs that are both fun to dance to and exciting to perform!</description>
