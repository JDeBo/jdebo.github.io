      <description>A little bit about me&amp;hellip;
I&amp;rsquo;m an experienced software developer with a love of music. Many years ago I began studying music as a possible career path. Through that pursuit I learned the value of criticism, developed a sense of creativity and got comfortable performing under pressure. Now I try to apply those same skills in the business world - whether it&amp;rsquo;s setting my ego aside during code reviews, solving architecture challenges infrastructure analysts or making technical topics digestible in executive briefings.</description>
