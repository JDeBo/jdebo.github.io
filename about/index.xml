      <description>Music has been a big part of my life since I picked up my first pair of drumsticks in fourth grade. In high school at Normal Community West I was introduced to marching band, and to this day I continue my work with that same program as an instructor for their drumline. In college my musical studies continued, taking me to Cuba with the Millikin percussion studio to study Afro-Cuban music, to Australia with my former high school to perform at the Sidney Opera House, and back to Cuba to perform with the Millikin Latin Jazz Project at the Havana International Jazz Festival.</description>

      <description>A little bit about me&amp;hellip;
I&amp;rsquo;m an experienced software developer with a love of music. Many years ago I began studying music as a possible career path. Through that pursuit I learned the value of criticism, developed a sense of creativity and got comfortable performing under pressure. Now I try to apply those same skills in the business world - whether it&amp;rsquo;s setting my ego aside during code reviews, solving architecture challenges or making technical topics digestible in executive briefings.</description>
